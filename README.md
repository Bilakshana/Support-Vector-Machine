# Support-Vector-Machine
A complete machine learning project that trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on breast cancer cell data and deploys it in a user-friendly Streamlit web app for real-time predictions. This project demonstrates the full workflow from data preprocessing and visualization to model training, evaluation, saving, and interactive deployment.
